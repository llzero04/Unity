# Breakout:

Breakout is the recreation of the breakout game from atari which is one of the most nostalgic games.<br/>

To try out, You can find the .exe file in the Builds folder. Just clone the repo and the game might open up ;)<br/>

The ball movement is a bit wonky right now, but will try to fix the mechanics.<br/>

Please let me know of any issues or bugs or suggestions. Will try to improvise the game more. Enjoy Gaming. THANK YOU!!

# Controls:
