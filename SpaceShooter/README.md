# Space Invaders 3D:

This is a 3D version of the original space invaders in 3D.<br/>

To try out, You can find the .exe file in the Builds folder. Just clone the repo and the game might open up ;)<br/>

Currently the game contains one level and there is ammo count on the lasers which can be shot.<br/>

Please let me know of any issues or bugs or suggestions. Will try to improvise the game more. Enjoy Gaming. THANK YOU!!

# Controls:

a => moves left<br/>
d => moves right<br/>
space_bar => the player can shoot laser<br/>
